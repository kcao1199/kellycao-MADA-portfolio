In the other education level, there is little variation in height. As for the comparison between income and weight, there appears to be little correlation between the two variables. Despite that, there is a slight negative relation between income and weight when showing a line of best fit.\nIn Table 1, the intercept provided an extremely high p=value, thus showing that the income and education variable affecting the height can not be proven or concluded."

Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata2, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nWarning: package 'here' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/malik/Documents/1.

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nWarning: package 'here' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/malik/Documents/1.

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

There are 19 years of data for each of the causes of death for 51 states from 1999 to 2017. I simulated the categorical variables, Year, State and Cause of Death using these parameters.

above coefficients to calculate the predicted log of ‘Number of Deaths’ for each observation in the synthetic data and then exponentiate predicted values to get the original Number of Deaths.

The Age-adjusted Death Rates resulted a negative number (-9) for the minimum which is not meaningful. Upon a detailed review, I found that 0.59% (57) of the total observations have negative values for the Age-adjusted Death Rate, highlighting a need for correction to ensure the meaningfulness of these observations. Several strategies, including imputation and treating these as missing values, offer viable solutions.\n\n#Checking counts of negative values\n\nsynthetic_data$Age_adjusted_Death_Rate[synthetic_data$Age_adjusted_Death_Rate &lt; 0]\n\n [1] -1 -2 -3 -4 -1 -2 -1 -2 -3 -1 -2 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -1 -2 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5\n[26] -1 -2 -3 -1 -1 -1 -2 -1 -2 -2 -3 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -1 -2 -1 -1 -2\n[51] -3 -4 -5 -1 -2 -3 -4\n\n\nThe histogram of the ‘Number of Deaths’ on the synthetic data resembles with that of the original data.The Age-adjusted Death Rates have lesser variability in the synthetic data.\n\n#Plotted the continuous variables\nggplot(synthetic_data, aes(x = `Number_of_Deaths`)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  ggtitle('Histogram of Number of Deaths  using Synthetic Data') +\n  xlab('Number of Deaths') +\n  ylab('Frequency') +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\nggplot(synthetic_data, aes(x = `Age_adjusted_Death_Rate`)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = \"lightgreen\", color = \"black\") +\n  ggtitle('Histogram of Age-Adjusted Death Rates  from Synthetic Data') +\n  xlab('Age-Adjusted Death Rates') +\n  ylab('Frequency') +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\nFollowing my collaborator’s work, I summarized and tabulated the categorical variables to check frequency. As expected, the results are similar to the original data.\n\n#Determining the summary of each year category\nsummary(synthetic_data$Year==1999)\n\n   Mode   FALSE    TRUE \nlogical    9180     510 \n\n#Tabulating the categorical variables for frequency of the output following Kelly's method.\ncause_of_death_table &lt;- table(synthetic_data$Cause_of_Death )\ncause_of_death_percentages &lt;- prop.table(cause_of_death_table)*100\nprint(cause_of_death_percentages)\n\n\n    Alzheimer's disease                  Cancer                    CLRD \n                     10                      10                      10 \n               Diabetes           Heart disease Influenza and pneumonia \n                     10                      10                      10 \n         Kidney disease                  Stroke                 Suicide \n                     10                      10                      10 \n Unintentional injuries \n                     10 \n\nstate_table &lt;- table(synthetic_data$State)\nstate_percentages &lt;- prop.table(state_table)*100\nprint(state_percentages)\n\n\n             Alabama               Alaska              Arizona \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n            Arkansas           California             Colorado \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n         Connecticut             Delaware District of Columbia \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n             Florida              Georgia               Hawaii \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n               Idaho             Illinois              Indiana \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n                Iowa               Kansas             Kentucky \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n           Louisiana                Maine             Maryland \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n       Massachusetts             Michigan            Minnesota \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n         Mississippi             Missouri              Montana \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n            Nebraska               Nevada        New Hampshire \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n          New Jersey           New Mexico             New York \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n      North Carolina         North Dakota                 Ohio \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n            Oklahoma               Oregon         Pennsylvania \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n        Rhode Island       South Carolina         South Dakota \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n           Tennessee                Texas                 Utah \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n             Vermont             Virginia           Washington \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n       West Virginia            Wisconsin              Wyoming \n            1.960784             1.960784             1.960784 \n\nyear_table &lt;- table(synthetic_data$Year)\nyear_percentages &lt;- prop.table(year_table)*100\nprint(year_percentages)\n\n\n    1999     2000     2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     2006 \n5.263158 5.263158 5.263158 5.263158 5.263158 5.263158 5.263158 5.263158 \n    2007     2008     2009     2010     2011     2012     2013     2014 \n5.263158 5.263158 5.263158 5.263158 5.263158 5.263158 5.263158 5.263158 \n    2015     2016     2017 \n5.263158 5.263158 5.263158"

When attempting to analyze the individual variables, it became apparent that the categorical variables had a more uniform distribution, with an equal number of observations per category. The continuous variables when plotted showed a more exponential distribution, with many of it’s observations being in the lower end of its range.\nWhen reviewing the statistics of the continuous variables, it become apparent how great the variation is in each variable, The column “Number of Deaths” has a mean of 3744.12621 and a high standard deviation of 28670.502. The column “Age-Adjusted Death Rates” has a mean of 60.47208 and a standard deviation of 129.967. With such a high standard deviation, it is suggested that both variables have a greater spread of data"

    "text": "Cleaning Data\nCleaning the data to match the data set identified in the plots shown above. I initially attempted to clean the data without AI assistance. From the reference plot, I was able to tell which variables were being filtered and used; however, I ended up being stuck at the determining the difference.\nI initially had each of the averages calculated with the summary() function, but it resulted in a single value output rather than the vector I required. I used ChatGPT 3.5 for the remainder of the cleaning process. I submitted my code and asked “How do I get the difference of the averages and get a vector?” The result added the group_by() function.\n\nsixth_and_twentieth_day &lt;- US_Birth_1994_2014 %&gt;%\n  filter(date_of_month == \"6\" | date_of_month == \"20\")\n\naverage_births_6th_20th &lt;- sixth_and_twentieth_day %&gt;%\n  group_by(day_of_week) %&gt;%\n  summarize(average_births_6th_20th = mean(births))\n\nthirteeth_day &lt;- US_Birth_1994_2014 %&gt;%\n  filter(date_of_month==\"13\")\n\n# Calculate the share of births on the 13th of each month\nbirths_13th &lt;- thirteeth_day %&gt;%\n  group_by(day_of_week) %&gt;%\n  summarise(births = mean(births))\n\n# I then calculated the difference between the share of births on the 13th day and the average births on the 6th and 20th days for each day of the week. The following lines used ChatGPT 3.5. I initially intended to use mutate() function and the pipe function to run it in one string, but ChatGPT recommended the following. \n\n# Calculate the difference in share of births on the 13th from the average of births on the 6th and 20th\ndiff_share_13th &lt;- births_13th$births - average_births_6th_20th$average_births_6th_20th\n# Creating the data frame with all of the variables and labels for plotting\nplot_data &lt;- data.frame(day_of_week = factor(1:7, labels = c(\"Mon\", \"Tue\", \"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\", \"Sun\")))"
